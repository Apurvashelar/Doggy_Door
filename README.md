# Automated Doggy_Door  

### Description  
An Automated Doggy Door, a doggy door that only lets dogs (and not other animals) in and out. We can keep our cats inside, and other animals outside where they belong.  
There is a readily available model that has been trained on a massive dataset, including lots of animals.  
The ImageNet challenge has produced many state-of-the-art models that can be used for image classification. They are trained on millions of images, and can accurately classify images into 1000 different categories. Many of those categories are animals, including breeds of dogs and cats. This is a perfect model for our doggy door. We're using the same pre-trained model in this.  


### Installations  
1. numpy
2. tensorflow
3. keras
4. matplotlib.pyplot


### Dataset  
As we're implementing this model using pre-trained model available. So we just need to import this model using keras.

### Output  
1. For dog image
